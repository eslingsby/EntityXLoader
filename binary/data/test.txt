The function also stops extracting characters if the end-of-file is reached. If this is reached prematurely (before meeting the conditions described above), the function sets the eofbit flag.

Internally, the function accesses the input sequence by first constructing a sentry object (with noskipws set to true). Then (if good), it extracts characters from its associated stream buffer object as if calling its member functions sbumpc or sgetc, and finally destroys the sentry object before returning.

The number of characters successfully read and stored by this function can be accessed by calling member gcount.
